```

This action makes use of the kexec function that should be compiled into the
tinkie kernel. This provides a faster alternative to rebooting, and allows an action to
effectively jump straight into the newly provisioned Operating System

The below example details all of the pieces of information that are required in order to kexec
into a newly provisioned Operating System. The `BLOCK_DEVICE` should point to where the kernel
/initrd on the newly provisioned operating system reside, and the `FS_TYPE` is required so that
the kexec action can mount the newly created Operating System and find it's kernel/initrd. The
paths should relate to the paths "inside" the newly provisioned OS along with the `CMD_LINE`
that will be required to boot the new OS successfully. To discover these things you may need to
examine the `/boot` folder in the newly written OS and look in the `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` to
understand the `CMD_LINE`. Sometimes `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` will exist as `/grub/grub.cfg` on a
partition that is mounted as `/boot`. If this happens, use `GRUBCFG_PATH` with `grub/grub.cfg`.

```yaml
actions:
- name: "kexec ubuntu"
  image: quay.io/tinkerbell/actions/kexec:latest
  timeout: 90
  pid: host
  environment:
      BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda3
      FS_TYPE: ext4
      KERNEL_PATH: /boot/vmlinuz
      INITRD_PATH: /boot/initrd
      CMD_LINE: "root=/dev/sda3 ro"
```

Troubleshooting:

`function not implemented` - If this error is reported and the `kexec` fails this is due to the kernel that tinkie is running, not supporting kexec.

No kexec occurs after a few seconds, but the action completes succesfully. Ensure that `pid: host` is part of the action, this is required so that
kexec to the new kernel occurs in the correct namespace.
